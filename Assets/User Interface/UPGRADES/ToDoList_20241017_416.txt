To do:

1. Settings/Global variables class for variables like isGameActive, GameStates, Win/Loss state, etc

2. Projectile base class to handle shared properties between projectile types

3. Gameplay instructions available in pause menu, options menu and in game

4. Create Upgrade UI screen. (Does not need to be connected to states, it can work like options)

5. The loop should allow navigation through: even with placeholder screens.
	Gameplay > Results Screen > Upgrade Screen > Back to Gameplay
	Main Title Screen
